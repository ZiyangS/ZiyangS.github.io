                My research <strong><em>accelerates</em> and <em>automates</em> unsupervised ML</strong> (e.g., <strong>anomaly detection</strong>): (1) how to speed up large-scale learning tasks with <strong>ML systems</strong> and (2) how to <strong>automate</strong> unsupervised ML model selection and hyperparameter optimization.
                I build AI/ML applications in finance, healthcare, and security.

                        <b> Keywords</b>: unsupervised ML, ML systems, Automated ML, anomaly/outlier/out-of-distribution (OOD) detection.

                    I also wrote an article about these opportunities in Chinese: <a href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/635612451"> 加入USC ASAP Lab来和我一起策"马"扬鞭！</a>

                    Participating in a project together provides a beneficial environment for us to assess our compatibility before committing to a long-term advisee/advisor relationship.
        And the cherry on top: you might obtain a strong reference letter and secure better offers than that of USC :-)
