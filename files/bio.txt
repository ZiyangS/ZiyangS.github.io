Ziyang Song is a PhD candidate of Computer Science at McGill University, supervised by Prof. Yue Li.
My research is centered on developing AI techniques for healthcare applications, with a focus on generative AI and probabilistic machine learning.
Specifically, I apply ML techniques in generative AI and probabilistic machine learning to analyze diverse medical data, including EHRs, biosignals, and genomics data.
My research of probabilistic models has been implemented at the CHU-SJ hospital, helping clinicians identify high-risk patients often overlooked by traditional rule-based methods.
