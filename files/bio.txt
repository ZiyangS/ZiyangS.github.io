Ziyang Song is a PhD candidate of Computer Science at the McGill University, supervised by Prof. Yue Li.
My research is centered on developing interpretable artificial intelligence (AI) models for healthcare applications.
Specifically, I apply ML techniques in generative AI and probabilistic AI to analyze diverse medical data, including EHRs, biosignals, and genetic data.
My work aims to address critical challenges in clinical decision support, including forecasting patient health trajectories, personalizing medication, and predicting disease risks.
Notably, my research of interpretable probabilistic models has been implemented at the CARTaGENE group of CHU-SJ hospital, identifying high-risk individuals often overlooked by traditional methods.
